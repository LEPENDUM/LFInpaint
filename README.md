## Content
- LF_utilities

Basic tools for light fields(display, refocus, save as a png sequence).

- homography_tools

Tools for generating random homographies and warping.

- LRTC

Low rank matrix completion code based on ADMM method. Both trace norm and rank minimization are available.

- misc_utilities

Additional tools.

- LFData

Directory for input data. A Light Field example is given.

- readHCI_LF.m

Load light field data from png files as well as inpainting mask, segmentation data and inpainted central view.

- RandomHomography.m

Main inpainting propagation program.

## Usage
1. Launch readHCI_LF to read a light field with pre-inpainted central view + Mask.

(Original light field stored in M_org matrix)

2. Launch RandomHomography for propagation to all views.

(Inpainted light field stored in X_rec matrix)

3. Display (or save) lightField matrix with displayLFMatrix (or saveLFMatrix)

e.g. Video = displayLFMatrix(X_rec,imgSize,nU,nV,1);
